Security issuance is a pillar of the financial system. SDC Platinum records that the total amounts of newly issued corporate equity, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds are &dollar;102 billion, &dollar;883 billion, and &dollar;410 billion, respectively, in the U.S. in 2022. Despite the high volume, it has been argued that security issuance has not reached its full potential in terms of serving the real economy due to the “high levels of fees” in the underwriting process (Financial Times, 2017). For example, underwriters earned &dollar;85 million in fees from the &dollar;3.4 billion Snap, Inc. IPO. The 2.5% ratio (to the principal amount), however, actually lies in the lower range among recent tech IPOs (CNBC, 2017).

How should we view the underwriting fees? Are underwriters rightfully compensated for performing their tasks, perhaps because security underwriting is inherently intricate and involves considerable risks? Or do underwriters possess market power and earn economic profits beyond the competitive level? If so, to what extent do they have market power? Academic research on these questions lags the public interest. A particular empirical challenge for the more eye-catching market of corporate securities underwriting is that it is a national market. Firms tend to seek underwriting services from a limited number of Wall Street firms for bond and equity issuance. Hence, if any events, such as M&As among underwriters, shift the extent of underwriter market power, all issuing firms will be affected, and there is a lack of a valid control group.

The municipal bond underwriting market provides a natural laboratory for studying these questions. It rivals corporate securities underwriting markets in the amount of issuance and is instrumental in providing funding for the nation’s public projects. Additionally, it is a much more geographically fragmented market compared to corporate securities underwriting. For example, none of the top three underwriters in California during 2010-2020 is a top ten in Massachusetts, nor vice versa. Moreover, it is a dynamic industry with significant consolidating activities in recent decades. These features allow me to study the effects of M&As among underwriters as shifters of market power, and use areas not affected by M&As as the control group in my scientific inference.

I hand-collect the sample of M&As among municipal bond underwriters during 1970-2022. I find 157 M&As among underwriters with geographic overlap. I define that an area is affected by underwriter M&As if both sides operate there and the deal is significant enough to raise the degree of concentration in the local underwriting market. Figure 1 shows the example of the M&A between SunTrust Bank and Equitable Securities. While SunTrust Bank underwrote in many states in the U.S. Southeast, Equitable Securities was more localized and focused on the state of Tennessee. Their M&A would affect the areas where they both operated, such as “Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro, TN”, but not the areas where only one side operated in, such as those in Florida. For each treated area, I look for a control area that is the closest in terms of population and average income but is not affected by consolidation during the concurrent period itself. Figure 2 gives some examples of my treatment-control matched sample.

I first investigate the effects of underwriter M&As on the underwriting spread, i.e., the difference between the offering price to initial investors and the proceeds that the government receives, which is expressed as a fraction of the principal amount and constitutes the revenue of underwriters. I find that it rises by 5.7 basis points from a sample mean of 102.9 basis points. For a median bond issue with an amount of &dollar;8.4 million, the increase corresponds to a &dollar;4,777 greater financial burden on the issuing government. A median county would incur &dollar;19,560 more in the underwriting spread annually. Figure 3 illustrates the dynamics of the difference in the underwriting spread in treated relative to control areas. Consistent with investment banks wielding their pricing power in more concentrated markets, the effects double for larger M&As and triple in highly concentrated areas. The offering yield also rises in less competitive markets or under negotiate sales, consistent with underwriters also influencing offering terms in a way that makes the securities easier to market and distribute but at the cost of issuers.

To ensure a scientific approach in making a causal interpretation of my findings and to mitigate the possibility of spurious correlations, I conduct a range of additional tests. The primary concern is that local economic dynamics could be driving both M&As and the underwriting spread. I show that the effects hold when I examine scenarios where the M&A-affected areas account for only a small fraction of the total businesses of the merging underwriters or when I consider only M&As for which the driving reasons, according to news reports, are orthogonal to the local economy. In both cases, the M&As are unlikely to be driven by local economic dynamics that could simultaneously affect the underwriting spread. I also show that the effects are absent for M&As among underwriters that are geographically apart in their businesses, M&As that are withdrawn, or M&As among purely commercial banks without underwriting services.

The debate on M&As constantly revolves around two major themes—market power and efficiency gains. While I have established that M&As that increase the market power of underwriters lead to a higher underwriting spread, an interesting question in my specific setting is whether issuers are harmed by M&As overall. I next investigate whether there are efficiency gains to the M&As, and, if so, whether issuers enjoy benefits that could compensate for the rise in the underwriting spread. I find that issuers are less likely to use credit ratings, bond insurance, or financial advisors post M&As, suggesting that there are some efficiency gains to the consolidation. The underwriters might have gained stronger abilities to market and distribute the bonds after M&As, making the use of credit ratings, a type of third-party certification, or the credit guarantee of bond insurance less necessary. The underwriters might have also acquired expertise that usually resides in the domain of financial advisors through M&As, and this kind of in-house integration might have reduced the issuers’ demand for formally hiring a financial advisor. However, I also find that the reduction in these costs is way too small to offset the rise in the underwriting spread, and the issuers are, on the whole, negatively impacted by M&As.

Finally, I validate my findings using data from the Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. I find that the total interest costs borne by local governments increase after M&As. I also show a quantity effect in that the new issuance of debt drops in treated areas. The local governments levy more property taxes but receive less inter-governmental transfers. Overall, their budget deficits widen. This evidence of a deterioration in local government finances from the survey data is consistent with the bond issue level outcomes.

My findings provide a novel perspective on bank antitrust regulations that traditionally focus on deposit-taking and lending activities. President Biden has expressed support for bank antitrust reform and signed an executive order directing the Justice Department to work with bank regulators to heighten the scrutiny of bank M&A deals. The policy debate has been informed by research showing that bank mergers cause branch closures, raise borrowing costs and fees, reduce credit access, endanger communities’ financial health and safety, and disproportionately impact low- and moderate-income communities. My paper highlights an often-neglected aspect in bank antitrust scrutiny, investment banking activities, that is beyond the traditional scope and yet has significant implications for both the underwriting outcomes and issuers’ overall financial health.
